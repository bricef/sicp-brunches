;   Exercise 2.78
;   =============
;
;   The internal procedures in the scheme-number package are essentially
;   nothing more than calls to the primitive procedures +, -, etc.  It was
;   not possible to use the primitives of the language directly because our
;   type-tag system requires that each data object have a type attached to
;   it.  In fact, however, all Lisp implementations do have a type system,
;   which they use internally. Primitive predicates such as symbol? and
;   number? determine whether data objects have particular types.  Modify
;   the definitions of type-tag, contents, and attach-tag from section
;   [2.4.2] so that our generic system takes advantage of Scheme's internal
;   type system.  That is to say, the system should work as before except
;   that ordinary numbers should be represented simply as Scheme numbers
;   rather than as pairs whose car is the symbol scheme-number.
