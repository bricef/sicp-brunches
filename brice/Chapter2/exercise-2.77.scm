(prn "Louis Reasoner tries to evaluate the expression (magnitude z) where z is

(Q: "Describe in detail why this works.")
(A: "Adding the following:

    (put 'real-part '(complex) real-part)
    (put 'imag-part '(complex) imag-part)
    (put 'magnitude '(complex) magnitude)
    (put 'angle '(complex) angle);...

To the complex number package will allow us to call
`(magnitude z)` because the complex package will defer
to the underlying complex number implementation for the
functions.

We can see this would be the case because the functions
have already been generically defined:

    (define (real-part z) (apply-generic 'real-part z))
    (define (imag-part z) (apply-generic 'imag-part z))
    (define (magnitude z) (apply-generic 'magnitude z))

In the arithmetic package. Without adding this
specification to the complex package, a generical call
to `magnitude` on a complex number will fail, as no
function has been associated to `magnitude` in for `complex`
in the dispatch table.
")

(Q: "Trace through all the procedures called in evaluating the
expression (magnitude z) In particular, how many times is
apply-generic invoked?  What procedure is dispatched to in each case?")

(A: "
1. (magnitude (list complex rectangular (cons 3 4)))
  ; arithmetic-operations/magnitude

2. (apply-generic 'magnitude (list complex rectangular (cons 3 4)))

3. (magnitude z)
  ; complex/magnitude

4. (apply-generic 'magnitude (list rectangular (cons 3 4)))

5. (magnitude (cons 3 4))
  ;rectangular/magnitude

As seen above, apply-generic is called twice, once for each type tag.
For the first tag (`complex`), the magnitude procedure called is the
complex package's magnitude procedure, which itself calls the
`apply-generic` procedure. The next time `magnitude` is called, it
is the rectangular package's magnitude procedure, which gives the
correct answer:

  (magnitude z)
